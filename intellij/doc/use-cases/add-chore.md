   2. If user selects change, system gives user two options: To change only the conflicting chore times or change them all
      1. If user selects change them all, system goes back to step 8. If user selects change conflicting, then system provides user with a way to change the chore times.

**9a.** If user chooses custom timing for the chore:

2. User selects which days they want the chore to be assigned

**12a.** If user rejects:

   1. If user selects delete chore:
      1. System asks for confirmation 
      2. User confirms
      3. System returns to chore list
   2. If user selects edit chore:

      2. User edits information accordingly
         1. If time edit leads to conflict, follow 7a.
      3. System resumes at step 11.
