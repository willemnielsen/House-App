##Iteration Plan 1
###Use case rankings
1. Add Items
2. Calendar
3. Assign Chore

To start, we will work on the "add items" use case. 
This use case adds items to the group shopping list. The shopping list is the 
premier feature for our application, so we decided to work on it first.
The shopping list allows us to collect data on our user, which could 
be profitable in the future. Further, the shopping list
is not as widely available as something like a calendar. Lastly, working 
on the add items use case will help us with other "add" use cases, such
as "assign chore" and "add event" for the calendar.
