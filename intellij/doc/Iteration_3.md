## Iteration Plan 3

Will have added: UI for all use cases impleneted in interation 1 and
    **Calender** , **~Login System**

will then add: data presestance to device and server and ability to edit and delete items, events, and housemates.



To start Iteration 3, we will work on data presestance.
This will allow the user to save their progress on the app and not
have to start from ground zero. Then we will work on editing and deleting data.
this will allow to user to dynamicly chage previous data entered.
