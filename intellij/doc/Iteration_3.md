## Iteration Plan 3

Will Have Added: UI for all use cases implemented in iteration 1, 
    **Calender**, and **Login System**

Will Then Add: Data persistance to device and server. Also will be able to edit and delete items, events, and housemates.



To start Iteration 3, we will work on data persistance.
This will allow the user to save their progress on the app and not
have to start from ground zero. Then, we will work on editing and deleting data.
This will allow the user to dynamically change previous data entered.
