## Iteration Plan 2

Will have added: **add item** and **split shopping list**

will then add: **Calendar** and **Login System**

To start Iteration 2, we will work on the Calendar use case.
This use case will allow the user to add event to the calendar which 
will plan and organize the reposibilities and space of the house. 
The calendar will be a multipurpose feature inergating many add features
such as "add chore", "add reservation", ect...
Having added the shopping list it makes sense to add the next most 
important feature. Having added the feature which are most critical
to the app will help assist us in our data storge process and GUI
design on late Iteration.
